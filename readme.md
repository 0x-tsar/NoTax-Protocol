# NoTax Protocol

### If we really are organizing ourselves towards a true decentralized world we need to settle on how we can contribute with our communities. In theory today this is done by the government stealing our money in the form on taxes and not returning in real results in our daily basis, now what if I told you you could help build the next Hospital or help to have a clean city or any other thing the government was supposed to do and still take 100% of your money back? On top of it you still make points of contribution that can be used to exhibit that you do contribute with your community by doing the work the government was supposed to do at the same time of no doing work at all, that is crazy, right!?
